- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @InfinitelyCurious AKA Olivia A. Greene
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in Astrophysics at Vanderbilt Univeristy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on classifying E+A galaxies out of MaNGA's MPL-11. In this process I use IFS data to generate spatially resolved diagnostic maps
     of each gaalxy in my candidate sample. This requires a lot of spectral synthesis codes, python plotting, and the use of tools like Marvin and IRAF. 
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning how to use Linux virtual box, and how to use Monte Carlo codes for creating galaxy simulations.
